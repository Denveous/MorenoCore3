     This is a "modded" TrinityCore server with changes to the core/database/client patches/etc. 

  * Side Note: This is only set to public for my own sheer convinence and laziness, this is not *technically* here for just anyone to compile, if you plan to, it may be missing files (core scripts, sql, and client patches needed) and therefore may not function properly, I *will not* help anyone run this unless you're invited to join us, not trying to be rude; however this is for personal use and learning currently. ðŸ¤ª
